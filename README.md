 candidates for new default set of Dashboard gramplets
The 5.1.5-1 version of Gramps default to include a [Welcome to Gramps!](https://gramps-project.org/wiki/index.php/Gramps_5.1_Wiki_Manual_-_Gramplets#Welcome) gramplet and the [Top Surnames](https://gramps-project.org/wiki/index.php/Gramps_5.1_Wiki_Manual_-_Gramplets#Top_Surnames) gramplet in the Dashboard category view.

The Welcome! is being updated but the proposed new instructions are still too generic and are only useful for the first few sessions of use.

A better set might be revisions of the "What's Next?", "To Do" and a more adaptive "Welcome to Gramps!"
